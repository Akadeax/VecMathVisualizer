# Overview

The vecmath REPL shell language combines some elements of C++ with the more typical mathematical symbols such as the length of the vector.

Some mathematical functions (such as sin, cos, sqrt, ... work exactly as they would in C++, with
the major difference that these functions also work on vector types.
Code is entered line by line (which is typical for a REPL shell) and instead of a semi column (;)
each line is terminated simple by newline (in other words, by pressing ’enter’)
