# Objectives

This tool is a combination of three of my passions:
- Linear algebra : Linear algebra is a rich and intricate mathematical foundation for the majority of
functionality in a graphics or gameplay programming context. Transformations, angle calculations,
path planning, rendering, ... would be impossible without this tapistry of mathematical operation.

- Programming : ```”Creatio ex nihilo”``` - as programmers, we create something out of nothing and we
literally make our dreams come true. Programming is a fine art where you use just your brain to
think something into existance.

- Programming Language design : I designed the language myself, and with the help of the ANLTR
tool (http://antlr.org) I created implementations for C++ and Java. Designing your own programming language is an exhilarating experience and it is very rewarding to see your own programming language function and calculate things.
As such, I hope that apart from my personal satisfation this vecmath tool helps you with vector
math calculations. These calculations are typically cumbersome and error prone and this tool aims to
help by having dedicated and simple instructions to perform these operations.
