#your friendly neighbourhood help

#Available commands
help or '?': prints this very helpful message.
precision number : sets the floating point precision (for output!) to the specified number of decimal places.
print variableName : prints the value of the variable name to output.
printAll : prints the values of all the current variables to output.
clear : clears all the variables
clear variableName : clears one specific variable.
joke : prints a random funny (not funny) joke.
exit or bye : stops this fine REPL shell.
#Variables
a=1.0 -> creates a scalar value, internally this will be stored as a one dimensional vector.
b=[1.0] -> creates a scalar value (a one dimensional vector).
c=[2,3] -> creates a two dimensional vector.
d=[2,3,9] -> creates a three dimensional vector.
z=[2,(3)] -> creates the complex number  2 + 3i.
q=[3,(2,3,9)] -> creates a quaternion with i=2, j=3, k=9 and w=3.
#Constants:
pi, Pi or PI : the well known cake value.
e : eulers number.
#Operators
* : component wise multiplication.
/ : component wise division.
+ : component wise addition.
- : component wise subtraction, unary negation.
^ : raise vector, matrix or quaternion to a power.
. : dot product for vectors, complex multiplication for quaternions.
 # : cross product for vectors.
|v1| : calculates the norm or magnitude of the vector.
#Mathematical functions
sin, cos, tan : sine, cosine and tangent function of a value in radians. 
    These functions will be applied on all components.
asin, acos, atan : arc sine, arc cosine and arc tangent function. Returns an angle in radians. 
    These functions will be applied on all components.
norm : calculate the length of a vector, alternative for the | | notation.
sqrt : calculates the square root of all the components.
abs : calculates the absolute value of all the components.
con : calculates the conjugate of a quaternion or complex number.
inv : calculates the inverse of a variable. 
    For a scalar this is 1/x, 
    for a 2d vector [1/x,1/y], 
    for a complex number or quaternion this is the actual inverse.
rad2deg : converts a value in radians to degrees.
deg2rad : converts a value in degrees to radians.
