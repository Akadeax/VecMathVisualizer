# DAE Code of Conduct

## INTRODUCTION

DAE is more than just a degree; as you enter The Level, you become a member of the community - a vibrant, international community that
promotes mutual respect and collective growth. Though this community is one with quite technical aspirations, we believe it is crucial
 that we do not lose sight of the social/ethical implications that will continue to shape your journeys in the game industry and beyond.
 
**Our community is *for* and *by* the students** - and to the students we pledge our commitment to upholding a campus culture of openmindedness,
inclusivity, acceptance, and connection. Each of us brings a different story to DAE - and we believe that stories are much more dynamic
when they are brought together.

**We support an inclusive environment - one in which you can be unforgivably yourself**. We are fully committed to supporting each of
you in realizing your fulles potential inside and outside of the classroom. In response, we ask for your commitment to the following
ethical framework - shaped by your fellow students. After all, the community would not exist without you.

This ethical code - what we like to call our **"Mission Statement"** - defines what we stand for, together. This Mission Statement also
links seamlessly with Howest's core values: Serve, Empower, Care.

We additionally include an overview of well-being support routes toward the end of this document, as we believe ethics and well-being
are innately intertwined.
This is an invitation to commit, to support, to thrive - together. Ethics isn't just an abstract idea - it's something we can commit to
in tangible ways. We look forward to exploring these topics with you - and remember, we're always here to listen.


## We believe in talking about ethics.

**What *is* ethics, exactly? What does it *actually* mean for us? Why should we care?**

For us, ethics manifests itself through our behaviour; **almost all choices we make haven an ethical undertone**.
The way we present ourselves - and the way in which we show mutual respect - reflects our inner beliefs and values. 

> ### As a student community, we hold the following to be central to our story: Respect, positivity, passion and effort.

Ethics doesn't exist in a vacuum - it's not a separate or independent entity. Rather, it's intertwined with almost everything we do -
there's latent ethical content in the things we say, read, watch, study, etc. Given this, ethics is inevitably part of the culture
at DAE.

** So - let's talk about ethics.** Let's rewrite the narrative that this is a supplementary idea, an afterthought of action. With
 a focus on prevention, equality, and well-being, we'll bring ethics to life on our campus.

## We believe in community guidelines

In some courses, teachers start the semester by creating a "class guideline" together with students. The same happens in every workplace
or organization. When different people from varying backgrounds come together, we are bound to experience some kind of confrontation
with difference. It can be challenging to assess what might be acceptable behaviour - and what may not be - when we have varying opinions
of what we can accept as *good*. Of course, we see that the division of behaviours as "good" or "bad" is far too polarize - and, through
this document, **we aim to sort through different behavioural situations possibly encountered at DAE, with the main goal of setting
guidelines for acceptable behaviour in context.**

We encourage you to this as ***an invitation to demonstrate values in a positive way*** - and, in doing so, contributing to the
well-being of the greater DAE community.

**It is our goal that this Mission Statement actively lives within our community** - after all, a document tackling topics of ethics,
 behaviour, and well-begin only truly exists if its contents are reflected through action. It is our aim - and our invitation to all
 of you, who make this community so vibrant - to cultivate a Mission Statement that truly *breathes*. This is the section of this document
 that exists for and by the students of DAE, with a collective mindset toward respect and growth.
 
 As members of the DAE Community, we are called to ask ourselves - what do we stand for? What makes an environment an inclusive one - one that
 celebrates difference while still finding unity? What standards can we expect each other to uphold in terms of ethical behaviour? What can we
 expect from each other - and how can we ensure a mutually respectful and supportive environment, both on and offline?
 
 These Community Guidelines are not intended, by any means, to exist soley as a list of rules. Rather, the following framework is a positive,
  additive one - one that explains who we are as a community. It is an invitation for each person to exhibit values in a positive way - it is
 not an invitation to punish or an invitation to sanction.
 
 > ### A positive community is only established through a positive lens.

Our Community Guidelines have been curated (with extensive input from fellow students) in order to build and support a thriving DAE campus.

### Respect of all identities
> #### We respect everyone as they are - period!

**We do not tolereate discrimination and/or hateful speech**. No matter your age, gender, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, religion
or ability status, you are worthy - and will be embraced accordingly as part of the DAE Community.

**What we do tolerate: *Respect and acceptance*.**

Our students are unique and equally valid. Regarding gender, ***we kindly ask you to use other's preferred pronouns*** (i.e. She/her/hers, 
he/him/his, They/Them - this is a non-exhaustive list). By aiming to use correct pronouns, we show the other person that we respect their
identity and are committed to an inclusive campus environment.

If using pronouns does not feel comfortable to you, **please be patient and keep in mind that our student community is ever-growing
and increasingly diverse**. Important: Everyone makes mistakes - and it's OK to do so if there is no malicious intent. If you misgender
someone, apologize and simply try to get it right next time. If you are misgendered, politely correct the
other party and move forward together. We're all learning - in the meantime, let's do everything we can to show respect and 
ensure comfort.

### Bullying & harassment : no tolerance policy

***Bullying and harassment are not tolerated in any form.*** Both can be detrimental to mental and physical health and are in no way
constructive or restorative.

Do not organize, participate in, or encourage the bullying and/or harassment of others. This includes:

- Verbal bullying
- Relational bullying (emotional manipulation)
- Cyberbullying
- Sexual bullying
- Prejudicial bullying (i.e. usage of slurs)
- Making threats
- Continued attempts toward unwanted contact

If you witness something (either online or offline) that might resemble bullying and/or harassment, please immediately notify a member
of the Community team and/or Allie Weis, Ethics coordinator in international Game Development (allie.weis@howest.be). Be a positive
influence and a source of support - not a bystander. **Let's take care of each other**.

### Positive communication & reinforcement

We'll keep it sweet, simple and to the point here - ***our community stands for Positivity.***

This means:
- Giving constructive feedback
- Reaching out to other student(s) if it seems that they are struggling
- Want to learn how to detect signals and support others? Are you looking to make a difference in your student community? Become 
a buddy with Buddy & Mind, a project designed by STUVO to increase solidarity and emphasize peer support & well-being.
- Surrounding yourself with positive influences - "You are the sum of the five people you spend the most time with."
- Offering motivational messages and framing your communication in a positive way.
- Referring others to external resources (study coaching and/or STUVO, for example) - be an ambassador of support.
- Respecting personal boundaries (if you're not sure where these boundaries lie, just ask!)
- Keeping an open mind to topics of cultural sensitivity.

### Online do's and don'ts

Let's be honest: your laptop is your best buddy. You likely have both online and offline lives, as it's inevitable to spend
a significatn amount of time behind your screen as a DAE student. Just as it's important to establish boundaries regarding
in-person communication, it's equally as important to establish these for online behaviour. While there is much overlap between
the two (\*ALL aformentioned guidelines apply in the virtual sphere), **we find it important to explicitly highlight our expectations
for online communication.**

- Use professional communication (applies to both parties; do not write a message as if you were sending a text)
- Use common sense and maturity when posting issues or commenting. We ask that you please refrain from posting inappropriate content.
- Boundaries are extremely important in light of online communication. It can be easy for things to be misinterpreted - as tone and content
can be tricky - so be sure to establish boundaries and be expressive of these.
- Tone indicators (i.e. /j -> Joking) may be an interesting tool to use, especially if you are unsure if the tone in your online communication
is clear. Tone indicators help to prevent misunderstandings and misinterpretations.

### Privacy policy

**Please respect others' privacy online;** no one is obliged to provide identifiable information. Ask another student politely and
privately if you need identifying information (as simple as asking for a friend's phone number or address online - keep this private). 
If an individual puts identifiable information online, do ask consent first before using this information.

## Cross-border behaviour

The aim of this Mission Statement is not - in any way - to penalize our student community or to assert rules or regulations without
student input. **We prefer guidance and support over sanctioning**. With this being said, however, it is important to understand
that there are consequences following inappropriate/cross-border behaviour. It is our utmost hope that every member of the DAE
Community complies with our guidelines. However, if these are not complied with, further steps will be taken to ensure the well-begin
of self and other.

**It is important to understand that each situation will be handled on a case-by-case basis, as there is not a "one size fits all" 
solution for inappropriate behaviour.**

**If you feel your boundaries have not been respected, immediately contact a member of the Community Team.** It is our responsability
to ensure the safety of our campus environment - and it is our role to ensure that DAE is a place in which every student can be
themselves, comfortably.

## Endnote: Ethics at DAE

It's true that our curriculum is a technical one - as is the digital entertainment industry itself - though **the importance
of ethics is steadily gaining international attention.** The relationships we choose to engage in, the things we create, the stories
we tell, the themes we choose to include in our narratives - it's all ethically infused.

What's the importance of this? We believe it makes for better content - for it has the power to demonstrate values in a digestible, 
visually-appealing way. People sometimes think that ethics and entertainment can't go hand-in-hand -  **but the power of entertainment
lies in its ability to share messages through a medium that is far more relatable - and far more accessible - than conventional 
educational tools.**

The ethics is here and now - both in education and in the industry itself. **Consider this an invitation to allow topics
of diversity and inclusion - equality and equity - to inform your work. Your work will benefit - as will you.

A very special thanks to those who helped in writing this Mission Statement. This document - which we envision as a living
and breathing guideline - was largely contributed to by the DAE Student Ethids Working Group. Sincerest gratitude is owed to the students
who took time to contribute to the well-being, safety, and security of the DAE Community. It's your home away from home.

This Mission Statement will grow over time - as we all do. If you have feedback and suggestions - or would like to get involved with
ethics at DAE - please send them to Allie Weis (allie.weis@howest.be)

***Let's keep building our community - together.***
